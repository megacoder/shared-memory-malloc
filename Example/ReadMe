Usage:  example filename

This example will bring up an arena using the memory mapped file specified by
filename; it will then sleep for ten seconds.  One may bring up other copies of
the example program during that time interval.  Eventually they wake up and
clean up.  The last one removes the shared memory resources.

I suggest running example in different terminal windows.
