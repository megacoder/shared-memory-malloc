USLOCKS

NAME
	uslocks -- support for semaphore locking with shared memory access

SYNOPSIS
	#include <arena.h>
	#include <ulocks.h>
	usnewlock(usptr_t *usarena)
	usfreelock(ulock_t lock, usptr_t *usarena)
	ussetlock(ulock_t lock)
	uscsetlock(ulock_t lock,unsigned spins)
	uswsetlock(ulock_t lock,unsigned spins)
	int ustestlock(ulock_t lock)
	int usunsetlock(ulock_t lock)

DESCRIPTION

	At initialization time, the usconfig(CONF_INITUSERS,maxusers) command
	is used to specify the number of "users" that the arena will support.
	Actually this command specifies the quantity of semaphores in the
	semaphore set associated with the arena.  One may manipulate these
	semaphores with the following functions:

	usnewlock  : allocates a lock from the usarena and initializes it to zero.
	             Locks are semaphore based.  Returns a pointer to a ulock_t
		     structure.
                   
	usfreelock : this function frees all memory associated with the specified
	             lock.  Problems may occur if the lock is not a valid lock;
		     null locks are ignored.  The semaphore set associated with
		     the usarena is not released via this function.
                   
	ussetlock  : this function does a test&set of a semaphore lock.  The
	             semop() call it uses is atomic.  This call will block until
		     the semaphore is zero.  Returns -1 on failure (input lock
		     pointer is null, lock's semaphore id is negative, more locks
		     requested than the arena supports).  Otherwise, it returns 0.
                   
	uscsetlock : this function does a test&set of a semaphore lock.  If
	             "spins" is greater than zero, then it will determine if the
		     associated semaphore may be zero'd without blocking.
		     Otherwise the function will block and do a test&set of the
		     associated semaphore.
                   
	uswsetlock : currently, this function is the same as ussetlock().
                   
	ustestlock : returns the current value of the semaphore.  Will return
	             -1 on failure or a number greater than or equal to zero
		     otherwise.

	usunsetlock: this function releases the lock (ie. sets it to zero),
	             and will not block.  Returns -1 on failure, 0 else.
