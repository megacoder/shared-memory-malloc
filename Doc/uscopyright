The Package is defined to include any and all the files distributed in the
usarena.tar file: (whether compressed or not)

       arena.h ulocks.h ulocks.c usarena.c usinfo.c usinit.c usmalloc.c
       doc/
                example.c        usarenalockinit  uscopyright      uslocks
                usadd            usarenaunlock    usfreearena      usmalloc
                usarenalock      usconfig         usinit           usputinfo

I)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Package except
    that they must include this license text.  You can also distribute
    unmodified parts of Package, likewise unrestricted except that they must
    include this license text.  You are also allowed to include executables
    that you made from the unmodified Package sources, plus your own usage
    examples and Package scripts.

II) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Package,
    including executables and/or source code, when the following four
    conditions are met:

    1) This license text must be included unmodified.

    2) The modified Package must be distributed in one of the following five ways:

	  a) If you make changes to Package yourself, you must clearly describe in
	  the distribution how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks you (in
	  any way) for a copy of the modified Package you distributed, you must
	  make your changes, including source code, available to the maintainer
	  without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to include your changes
	  in the official version of Package.  What the maintainer will do with
	  your changes and under what license they will be distributed is
	  negotiable.  If there has been no negotiation then this license, or a
	  later version, also applies to your changes.  The current maintainer is
	  Charles Campbell <drchip@campbellfamily.biz>.  If this changes it will be
	  announced in appropriate places (most likely
	  http://mysite.verizon/net/astronaut/src) .  When it is completely
	  impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him your
	  changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has received
	  your changes they will not have to be sent again.

	  b) If you have received a modified Package that was distributed as
	  mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it unmodified,
	  as mentioned at I).  If you make additional changes the text under a)
	  applies to those changes.

	  c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of the
	  modified Package you distribute.  This may be done in the form of a
	  context diff.  You can choose what license to use for new code you add.
	  The changes and their license must not restrict others from making their
	  own changes to the official version of Package.

	  d) When you have a modified Package which includes changes as mentioned
	  under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the changes
	  if the following three conditions are met:

	  - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute
	    the changes to the Package maintainer without fee or restriction, and
	    permits the Package maintainer to include the changes in the official
	    version of Package without fee or restriction.
	  - You keep the changes for at least three years after last
	    distributing the corresponding modified Package.  When the maintainer
	    or someone who you distributed the modified Package to asks you (in
	    any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them
	    available to him.
	  - You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.  This
	    contact information must remain valid for at least three years
	    after last distributing the corresponding modified Package, or as long
	    as possible.

       e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,
	  you can distribute the modified Package under the GNU GPL version 2 or
	  any later version.

	3) A message must be added in a "Changes" file to be included in the
	   modified Package such that the user of the modified Package is able to
	   see that it was modified.  When distributing as mentioned under 2)e),
	   adding the message is only required for as far as this does not conflict
	   with the license used for the changes.

    4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be
       removed or changed, except that the person himself can make
       corrections.

III) If you distribute a modified version of Package, you are encouraged to use
	 the Package license for your changes and make them available to the
	 maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to do this is by
	 e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL to the
	 maintainer.  If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile)
	 e-mailing a context diff will do.  The e-mail address to be used is
	 <drchip@campbellfamily.biz>.

IV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the
	 Package sources, parts of it or from a modified version.  You may use this
	 license for previous Package releases instead of the license that they
	 came with, at your option.
