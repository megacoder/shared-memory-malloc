USPUTINFO

NAME
	usputinfo - puts an information pointer into the shared arena

SYNOPSIS
	#include "arena.h"
	int usputinfo(usptr_t *usarena,void *info)

DESCRIPTION

	This function assumes that the "info" pointer refers to information
	contained inside the shared arena.  It puts the information pointer
	into the USArena structure.

	There are three main structures defined by "arena.h":

		USFreeBin
			This structure holds the head and tail of a list of
			free memory chunks.

		USArena
			This local to the process data structure holds all of
			the arena parameters; a portion of it
			(the USArenaShare) is either copied from (or copied to
			if its the initial allocation) the shared memory to
			coordinate with other processes.
			
		USArenaShare
			This data structure is copied to the beginning of the
			shared memory.  It holds such things as the attach
			point, the IPC key associated with the shared memory,
			and the "info" offset.
	
	So, one may use usputinfo() to place a copy of the info pointer into
	shared memory.  Other processes will get that "info" pointer when
	they use usinit() or usadd().
